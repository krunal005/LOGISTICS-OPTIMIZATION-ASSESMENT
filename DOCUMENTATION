                                                  **Documentation for Logistics Optimization Assessment**

## Overview
This documentation describes the implementation of an end-to-end logistics optimization and analytics system designed for TransLogi, a logistics company. The system includes predictive modeling, route optimization, real-time monitoring, and a user-friendly dashboard. It is deployed as a modular and scalable containerized application.

## Components

### 1. Problem Definition
TransLogi aims to:
1. Predict delivery times for new orders.
2. Optimize delivery routes for multiple vehicles, considering constraints like traffic, weather, and capacity.
3. Monitor operational metrics through a dashboard.

### 2. Dataset
A synthetic dataset was generated for demonstration purposes. It includes the following columns:
- **distance_m**: Distance in meters.
- **traffic_score**: A score representing traffic intensity (0.5 to 1.5).
- **weather_score**: A score representing weather conditions (0.5 to 1.5).
- **delivery_time_minutes**: Actual delivery time in minutes.
- **order_time**: Timestamp of the order.
- **delivery_time**: Calculated delivery time.

The dataset is saved as `synthetic_delivery_data.csv`.

### 3. Data Preprocessing
1. Loaded the synthetic dataset.
2. Engineered features:
   - Converted distance to kilometers.
   - Computed time windows for deliveries.
3. Saved the processed data for model training and analysis.

### 4. Predictive Modeling
- **Algorithm**: Random Forest Regressor.
- **Features**: Distance (km), traffic score, and weather score.
- **Target**: Delivery time (minutes).
- **Model Output**: Saved as `delivery_time_model.pkl`.

### 5. Route Optimization
- **Algorithm**: Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) solver using Google OR-Tools.
- **Inputs**:
  - Locations (coordinates).
  - Demands and capacities for each vehicle.
  - Real-time constraints like traffic updates.
- **Outputs**: Optimized routes as a list of waypoints for each vehicle.

### 6. Backend (REST API)
Developed using Flask. Key endpoints:
- **/predict** (POST):
  - Inputs: Distance, traffic score, weather score.
  - Outputs: Predicted delivery time.
- **/routes** (POST):
  - Inputs: Locations, vehicle demands, and capacities.
  - Outputs: Optimized routes.

### 7. Deployment
- **Containerization**:
  - Entire application (backend, model, database, and UI) is containerized using Docker.
  - Supports multi-platform deployment.
- **Dependencies**:
  - Flask for API.
  - Google OR-Tools for optimization.
  - Folium for map-based visualization.
  - Joblib for model serialization.

### 8. UI and Dashboard
- **Tools**: Folium for creating interactive maps.
- **Features**:
  - Display optimized routes on an interactive map.
  - Visualize real-time metrics like traffic and delivery efficiency.
  - Input forms for submitting new delivery orders.

## Execution Steps

### A. Local Setup
1. Clone the repository containing the project.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Flask application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
4. Access the application at `http://localhost:5000`.

### B. Docker Deployment
1. Build Docker images:
   ```bash
   docker build -t logistics-app .
   ```
2. Run the application with Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```
3. Access the application at the specified IP or domain.

## Technical Challenges and Decisions
- **Challenge**: Balancing model accuracy with computational efficiency.
  - **Solution**: Random Forest provided a good trade-off between accuracy and speed.
- **Challenge**: Real-time route optimization.
  - **Solution**: Used a heuristic VRP solver for scalability.

## Bonus Features
1. **Real-time Delivery Tracking**: Simulated GPS tracking using Folium.
2. **Anomaly Detection**: Identified unusual delivery times for operational insights.
3. **Alert System**: Notified users about late deliveries.
